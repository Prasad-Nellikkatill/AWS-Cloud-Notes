2. **VPC Setup with EC2 Instances**: Creating a secure VPC with public and private subnets.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Automating the build, test, and deploy process using AWS CodePipeline.
4. **Containerized Application on ECS**: Deploying Dockerized applications using ECS and ECR.
5. **Infrastructure Automation with Terraform**: Using Terraform to automate the provisioning of AWS resources.
