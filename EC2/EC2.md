What is EC2, and why is it important?
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Access reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Scale capacity within minutes with SLA commitment of 99.99% availability.
- Provide secure compute for your applications. Security is built into the foundation of Amazon EC2 with the AWS Nitro System.
- Optimize performance and cost with flexible options like AWS Graviton-based instances, Amazon EC2 Spot instances, and AWS Savings Plans.


EC2 usescases
Deliver secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run HPC applications faster and cost-effectively.
Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWSâ€™s pay-as-you-go pricing.
Deliver the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects


## Key Features of EC2:
- Scalable: Adjust the number of instances based on demand.
- Cost-effective: You only pay for the resources you use.
- Secure: Integrates with security groups and VPC for safe networking.

## EC2 Instance Types:
1. **General Purpose**: Suitable for most workloads.
2. **Compute Optimized**: Best for computational tasks.
3. **Memory Optimized**: Ideal for applications requiring large amounts of memory.
4. **storage Optimized**: These instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.

## Launching an EC2 Instance:
Follow these steps to launch an EC2 instance:
1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Console.
2. Click **Launch Instance**.
3. Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image).
4. Select an Instance Type.
5. Configure instance settings and launch.
